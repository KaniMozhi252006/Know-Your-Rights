        <h6>CIVIL LAW ⚖️</h6>
    </div>
    <div class="container intro-section">
        <h2>Civil Law in India</h2>
        <p>
          Civil law is a branch of law that governs relationships between individuals, organizations, and institutions, primarily focusing on resolving private disputes and providing remedies for wrongdoings that do not involve criminal offenses. It encompasses a wide range of legal areas, including contracts, property, family disputes, torts (civil wrongs), and more, aiming to protect individuals’ rights and enforce obligations in personal and business relationships. In contrast to criminal law, which addresses offenses against the state or society, civil law is designed to ensure that private rights are respected and, when violated, offer compensation or redress.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="one">
        <p>Civil law is formed through a complex process involving the legislature, judiciary, legal principles, and sometimes customs and social norms. Primarily, civil law originates from statutes, where legislators draft, debate, and pass laws to address specific social needs and regulate personal and business relationships. Courts play a significant role in interpreting these statutes, applying them to cases, and setting judicial precedents that provide consistency and guidance for future cases. Additionally, legal principles and doctrines, such as equity and fairness, are often integrated into civil law to prevent rigid applications that could lead to unjust outcomes. Customary laws and traditions can also shape civil law, particularly in areas like family and property law, where long-standing community practices may be recognized in legal proceedings. Comparative law and international conventions sometimes influence civil laws as well, especially in areas with global standards, such as consumer protection and intellectual property. Law commissions and reform committees periodically review and recommend updates to ensure civil laws remain relevant to societal changes. Regulatory bodies further support civil law by creating detailed guidelines that clarify legal standards, especially in specialized areas like consumer rights and environmental protection. Together, these elements contribute to a structured yet adaptable legal system that upholds individual rights and responsibilities, providing stability, fairness, and justice in private and commercial relationships.</p>

                    Contract law governs agreements between individuals or entities. A contract is legally binding when there is an offer, acceptance, and consideration (exchange of value). Contract disputes arise when one party does not fulfill their obligations or terms, leading to breaches that may entitle the other party to compensation or other remedies.
                    <br>Common examples include purchase agreements, employment contracts, and service agreements. In cases of breach, remedies can include damages (monetary compensation) or specific performance, where a court orders the party to fulfill the contract terms.

                <p class="card-text">Tort law addresses civil wrongs or injuries caused to individuals by others, whether intentionally or through negligence. Common torts include defamation, trespassing, and negligence. In tort cases, the goal is often to compensate the injured party for harm suffered due to the other party’s actions.<br>
                    For example, a personal injury lawsuit in a car accident case may seek damages for medical expenses, lost income, and pain and suffering. Torts serve as a deterrent to negligent or harmful behavior and provide victims a means to recover for their losses.<br>
