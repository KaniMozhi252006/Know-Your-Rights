        <h2>Labour Law in India</h2>
        <p>
          Labour laws in India are a complex set of regulations that govern the relationship between employers and employees, aimed at ensuring fair wages, work conditions, and other worker protections. These laws are designed to provide workers with adequate rights and benefits while promoting a healthy and productive work environment. India's labour laws cover a wide range of aspects, including wages, industrial relations, employment conditions, and welfare schemes. The primary objective is to safeguard the interests of workers while maintaining a balance between industry growth and employee well-being.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Indian Labour Law system is governed by both central and state legislations, with key legislations such as the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972, and the Minimum Wages Act, 1948, playing a crucial role in the protection of workers' rights. Over the years, various reforms have been introduced to address the evolving nature of work, including reforms on contract labor, safety at work, and social security measures for workers in the unorganized sector.
