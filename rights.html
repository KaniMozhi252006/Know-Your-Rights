        <h6>BASIC HUMAN RIGHTS ✅</h6>
    </div>
    <div class="container intro-section">
        <p>
          Human rights are the fundamental rights and freedoms that every individual is entitled to, irrespective of their nationality, sex, ethnicity, language, or religion. In India, these rights are enshrined in the Constitution, which guarantees justice, equality, and liberty to all its citizens. The Constitution of India, through its Fundamental Rights (Articles 12–35), protects individuals against discrimination and ensures the dignity and freedom of each person. The recognition of these rights reflects India’s commitment to upholding human dignity and ensuring equal treatment for all its citizens.
          These rights are categorized into six major groups, which include the right to equality, right to freedom, right against exploitation, right to freedom of religion, cultural and educational rights, and the right to constitutional remedies. Together, they form the backbone of the Indian legal and moral system, promoting fairness and justice in society.

      <h1>Right to Constitutional Remedies (Article 32)</h1>
      <p>Right to Constitutional Remedies (Article 32) is considered the "heart and soul" of the Indian Constitution, as it empowers citizens to approach the Supreme Court or High Courts directly if any of their Fundamental Rights are violated. Through this right, citizens can seek immediate legal intervention to restore their rights, making the judiciary a powerful guardian of individual freedoms. The courts have the authority to issue specific writs for various purposes:<br>
        Habeas Corpus: Orders a person who is unlawfully detained to be brought before the court.<br>
        Mandamus: Directs a government official to perform a duty they are legally obligated to fulfill.<br>
        Prohibition: Stops a lower court from exceeding its jurisdiction.<br>
        Certiorari: Allows a higher court to review and potentially reverse a lower court's decision.<br>
        Quo Warranto: Questions the legal authority under which a person holds a public office.<br>
        This right ensures that Fundamental Rights are not only theoretical but are actively protected, enabling citizens to hold the state accountable.</p>
